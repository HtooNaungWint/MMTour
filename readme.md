![](static/img/logo-long-text-white-highlight.png)

Thank you for visiting my "Myanmar Tour" project
This project is built using nodejs and express
Database is MongoDB

Even though there are some business logic are need to be implemented
The application is up and running perfectly

Maybe I will try new features and technologies on this app
but I will not too focus on the business logic and some tedious works

- there is no hero page ðŸ«¤, maybe i will add it later
- some features are not implemented yet
- but instead i will move on with this project because I will just be doing same things over and over again
