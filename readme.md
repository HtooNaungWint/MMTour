![](static/img/logo-long-text-white-highlight.png)

Thank you for visiting my "Myanmar Tour" project
This project is built using nodejs and express
Database is MongoDB

Even though there are some business logic are need to be implemented
The application is up and running perfectly

Maybe I will try new features and technologies on this app
but I will not too focus on the business logic and some tedious works

Api Documentation Link
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/20362012/Uz5NjDLR

- almost all necessary api features are done such as password reset, pagination and CRUDs
- but some of the features are yet to implement to view page

https://mmtour.herokuapp.com/overview

- mobile view is not supported 🥲
- there is no hero page 🫤, maybe i will add it later
- some features are not implemented yet
- but instead i will move on with this project because I will just be doing same things over and over again

Mapbox for displaying map
Stripe for payment integration
