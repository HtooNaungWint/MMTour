Thank you for visiting my "Myanmar Tour" project
This project is built using nodejs and express
Database is MongoDB

Even though some business logic is needed to be implemented
The application is up and running perfectly

Maybe I will try new features and technologies on this app
but I will not too focus on the business logic and some tedious works

- almost all necessary api features are done such as password reset, pagination and CRUDs
- but some of the features are yet to implement to view page

View web site
